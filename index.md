**USE PINDELIVER AS YOUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM PLATFORM AND GET COMPETITIVE WITHIN LAST MILE**

pinDeliver is a cloud-based delivery platform that streamlines and digitizes the entire delivery process, from transport booking to follow-up, and all the important events that happens in between. Our platform is complete and at the same time flexible to meet our customers differences. Everyone can benefit from using pinDeliver.

**ONE PLATFORM, MULTIPLE INTERFACES**
pinDeliver provide different interfaces and modules for different stakeholders and users. We have a module for planning that is using machine learning and AI, a popular and intuitive driver support app, a first-class customer communication module and of course real-time overview for e.g. Transportation managers and Customer support. Our team of developers have made sure that pinDeliver is easy to use, for everyone!


**IN THE OFFICE**
Transport managers and Customer service work in our ‘OFFICE‘ interface. There are modules for planning, customer communication and follow-up. With pinDeliver as your ‘co-worker’ you will always be in control and the tool offers support for many different types of transport flows, for example coordinated distribution, transhipment and multiple pickups/deliveries.

**AT THE TERMINAL**
For picking, consolidation of orders and loading, pinDeliver offers support that streamlines the workflow, reduces the risk of errors and replaces manual handling. In addition the pinDeliver ‘TERMINAL’ app provide you with full control of goods that arrive and leave the terminal.

**ON THE ROAD**
Our team of developers have listened to the most experienced drivers and built a tool designed for them, the pinDeliver ‘GO’ app. Everyone need help sometimes and you want to get rid of unnecessary administration and being able to focus on delivering your very best job out there. With pinDeliver the drivers will get a detailed schedule, traffic directions, embedded GPS-support, signing on screen, deviation management and recycling. Everything they register will instantly transfer to pinDeliver ‘OFFICE’.

**AS A RECIPIENT**
As a recipient, you are mostly interested in one thing; when will my goods arrive? The pinDeliver ‘GET’ app for the end-customers will not just confirm delivery, but provide estimated delivery time, possibilities for customers to complete their delivery instructions, re-schedule a planned delivery and arrange for return pickups. There is also embedded support for anonymous end-customer surveys and ratings.  

For product owners and transportation companies the pinDeliver ‘GET’ app can be branded with logotypes and specific color schemes.

**BETWEEN DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS**
The delivery process generates a lot of information that other systems need to know about. It can be order systems, WMS, TMS, TA etc. With the ‘pinDeliver Service Center’ integration module it is easy to communicate with other parties. Read more about this under Integration.
