<p>The main communication form in pinDeliver is through SMS since it is a very fast and reliable communication form. It is possible to have general SMS settings for the whole account but it is also possible to have specific SMS settings for different senders. In that case you do the SMS settings under the specific sender. See <a href="senders.html">Senders</a>. If SMS settings are done for a specific sender that will override the setting described in this page. Remember that the explanations of the fields below is also valid for corresponding field from <a href="senders.html">Senders</a>.</p>
<p>As you see below several fields have the same purpose, that is to write message templates. These messages will be sent based on different triggers. All templates can have <strong>aliases</strong> (place holders) that replace an alias with a text from the customer order, for example customer name, estimated time of delivery. All <strong>aliases</strong> are described in the blue square to the right.</p>
<p>It is important to think through which triggers you want to use. Some triggers often come very close in the work process and then that could be seen as spamming the customer.</p>

<td>Approximately how many minutes before a planned delivery time a SMS should be sent to the customer.

Only stops within X minutes will get a message, and only one message. This means that if you have a tight schedule each stop will only get one message if if you have more stops within X minutes before reaching the stop. On the other hand, if you driving time between stops is more than X minutes that stop will not get any message at all.</td>
