<p>The primary mode of communication in pinDeliver is through SMS, known for its speed and reliability. While there are general SMS settings available for the entire account, you can also configure specific SMS settings for different senders. To set SMS preferences for a particular sender, navigate to the sender's settings under <a href="senders.html">Senders</a>. Please note that if SMS settings are configured for a specific sender, they will take precedence over the settings described on this page. Keep in mind that the explanations for the fields below also apply to corresponding fields in the <a href="senders.html">Senders</a> section.</p>
<p>As you can see below, several fields serve the same purpose: creating message templates that are sent based on various triggers. All templates can include aliases (placeholders) that are replaced with specific text from the customer order, such as the customer's name or estimated delivery time. Detailed information about <strong>aliases</strong> can be found in the blue square on the right.</p>
<p>It is essential to carefully consider which triggers you want to utilize, as some triggers may closely overlap in the workflow, potentially leading to excessive communication with the customer.</p>

Please note that only stops within X minutes will receive a message, limited to one message per stop. If your schedule is tight, each stop will only receive one message, even if there are multiple stops within X minutes before reaching the stop. However, if the driving time between stops is greater than X minutes, that stop will not receive any message at all.</td>
