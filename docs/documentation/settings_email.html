<p>The main communication form in pinDeliver is through SMS since it is a very fast communication form. But it is also possible to have email as communication method. This makes it possible to have more complex messages and also use HTML code to design them.</p>
<p>It is possible to have general email settings for the whole account but it is also possible to have specific email settings for different senders. In that case you do the email settings under the specific sender. See <a href="senders.html">Senders</a>. If email settings are done for a specific sender that will override the setting described in this page. Remember that the explanations of the fields below is also valid for corresponding field from <a href="senders.html">Senders</a>.</p>
<p>As you see below several fields have the same purpose, that is to write message templates. These messages will be sent based on different triggers. All templates can have <strong>aliases</strong> (place holders) that replace an alias with a text from the customer order, for example customer name, estimated time of delivery. All <strong>aliases</strong> are described in the blue square to the right. For each message it is possible to select if the message is HTML coded or just plain text.</p>
