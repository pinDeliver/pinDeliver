# Security

Since pinDeliver handles a lot of personal data such as address, phone number etc it is important to take security and GDPR seriously. On this page you can secure the data and prevent unauthorized login.

You can activate automatic anonymization of data by ticking **Activate delivery anonymization**. Then you have to choose after how many days you want to anonymize the data. Just enter the number of days in **Days until a delivery is being anonymized**.

It is also possible to use 2 factor authentication for all administrators. You do that by ticking **Activate multi-factor authentication for administrators**. If this setting is switched on then users with administrator permissions have to enter a verification code when signing in.

By using advanced password policy from *Company settings* it is also possible to autoblock a user when trying to login repeatedly with the wrong credentials. In that case an email will be sent to the email in **Security officer email address**
