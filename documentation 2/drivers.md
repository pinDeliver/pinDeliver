# Drivers
When you are pleased with the route optimization you will need to assign drivers to each route. A driver is not a user in pinDeliver. The driver will get the route instructions as a link sent to his mobile phone normally but email is also possible. A driver can be available for all delivery groups or just selected delivery groups. You specify this when adding the driver as below.

A driver is setup with a name but it is off course also possible to have generic drivers and instead of naming them with first name and last name you just fill in a generic name like "Driver car 1" or similar. This is useful if you use phones associated with each car instead of with a person.

To create a new driver you select Admin/Drivers from the main menu. A list of all drivers is shown and you just click **Add new driver** in the bottom of the list. To change an existing driver you just click the driver name or the **Edit** button to open the driver card.

Fill in all relevant fields in the driver card and click **Create driver** to save it. See image and field explanations below.
