# Send custom messages to customers

You have the option to send custom messages via SMS or email. This functionality can be triggered from various routes or manually accessed by clicking on **Messages** in the main menu. The primary distinction lies in the fact that when triggered from a route, there is no need to manually select customers on this page.

You can compose ad-hoc messages or use templates for convenience.

The messaging feature proves valuable, particularly when you need to manually send messages due to route delays or other reasons, reaching out to all remaining customers.

Messages can be sent as SMS, email, or a combination of both. Please bear in mind that SMS messages exceeding 140 characters will be counted as more than 1 message. The message length calculation displayed in the yellow box is an approximate estimate, particularly when using placeholders. The precise message length will vary across different customer orders.

### Writing a message
To compose an ad-hoc message, simply enter the desired text into the large message box. Alternatively, you can utilize *placeholders* to retrieve information from the customer order, such as the recipient's name or sender's name. For guidance on available placeholders, click the blue **Info** button.

If you have created templates, you can access them by clicking on **Message Templates** and selecting the template from the list at the bottom of the page.

To send the message, you will need to select the intended recipients, unless the message is triggered from a route, as explained below.

### Create a message template
Preparing message templates ahead of time offers a highly efficient method to ensure rapid and precise communication as the situation demands. These templates are particularly advantageous when time is limited, and it mitigates the risk of forgetting valuable information.  

To create a new message template, follow these steps:

* Click the **Message Templates** button.
* Select the language for the template text.
* Provide a brief description for your template. This will help when selecting the appropriate template from the message list.
* Compose the message template itself that will be sent to the customer. You can, of course, incorporate *placeholders* in your templates, and these are displayed in the blue box to the right.
* Once you have completed the template, click the **Add New Message Template** button.  

The template will now be accessible below the form for creating new messages.

### Selectinging customers

* Begin by clicking on **Select customers**.
* Enter the name of the route you are looking for; in the provided example, the route is named "GHI345".
* Next, you will need to specify which customers from that route you wish to send messages to by selecting their **status**. In the example, only unhandled customers have been chosen as displayed with the green button in the **Add depending on status** column.
