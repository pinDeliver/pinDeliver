# Send custom messages to customers

It is possible to send custom messages through SMS or email. This functionality can be triggered from the different routes or manually by clicking on *Messages* in the main menu. The only difference is that when triggered from a route you don´t need to select customers manually in this page.

It is possible to type an ad-hoc message or use templates.

The message functionality is for example used to trigger manual messages when a route has been delayed for some reason and you want to message all remaining customers.

It is possible to send messages as SMS, email or both. Remember that if you write SMS messages longer than 140 characters they will be counted as more than 1 message. The message length calculation shown in the yellow box is just approximately right iof you use *place holders*. The correct length will vary between different customer orders.

### Writing a message
To write an ad-hoc message you just type the message in the big message box. It is also possible to use *place holders* to get text from the customer order, for example name, sender name or more. If you want help to see which *place holders* that can be used you can click on the blue **Info-button**.

If you have created templates you instead click **Message-templates** and choose the template from the list at the bottom of the page.

To send the message you need to select customers unless triggered from a route, see below.

### Create message template
It is very practical to create different message templates before you need to use them. For example sometimes it is important to get the message sent really fast. By using a template you ensure that you don´t forget important information.

Click the button **Message-templates** to create a new template.

* Select language - Select language for the template text.
* Description - Enter a short description for your template. This is used for selecting the right template from the message list.
* Message-template - This is the text that will be sent to the customer. You can off course use **place holders** also for templates and you see them in the blue box to the right.

Click the **Add new message-template** button when done. The template will now be visible below the form for creating new messages.

To send the message you need to select customers unless triggered from a route, see below.

### Selecting customers
To manually select customers you search for a specific route. Start by selecting **Select customers** and the enter parts or the whole name of a route, in the example below the route is called GHI345. Then you need to select which customers from that route you want to send messages to by choosing the **status**, in the example only **unhandled** customers are choosen, see the green button in column **Add depending on status**.
