# Security

Since pinDeliver processes a significant amount of personal data, such as addresses and phone numbers, it is crucial to prioritize security and adhere to GDPR regulations. This page provides options to enhance data security and prevent unauthorized access.

You can enable automatic data anonymization by checking the **Activate delivery anonymization** option. Afterward, you can specify the number of days it takes for data to be anonymized by entering a value in the **Days until a delivery is being anonymized** field.

Additionally, you have the option to implement two-factor authentication for all administrators. Enabling **Activate multi-factor authentication for administrators** will require administrators to enter a verification code during the login process.

To further enhance security, you can configure an advanced password policy in the *Company settings*. This policy can automatically block a user's account after multiple unsuccessful login attempts, and an email notification will be sent to the email address specified in the **Security officer email address** field.
