# Click & collect

pinDeliver can also manage pickup orders, known as Click & Collect, where customers collect their orders from your warehouse. To enable this functionality, your warehouse must be configured as a Delivery Group, and you must activate "Use depots" and provide a depot address. The depot address represents the location where customers can pick up their goods, and it will be displayed on the customer’s information page as a map.

On this page, you have the option to display a QR code on the customer’s information page. This QR code can be scanned using the Hub app when customers arrive to collect their goods.

To display the QR code, the following conditions must be met:

* **Display QR-code on the customer page** must be set to **Yes** on this settings page.
* **Display the tracking number on the customer page** must also be set to **Yes** on the [Customer page](settings_customer_page.md).
* Each customer order must have a *Tracking number* assigned since this value is encoded in the QR code.
