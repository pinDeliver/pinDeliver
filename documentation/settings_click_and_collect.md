# Click & collect

pinDeliver can also be used to handle pickup orders, so called *Click & Collect*. These orders are picked by the customer on your warehouse. Your warehouse must be a *Delivery Group* and you must also activate *Use depots* and add a depot address. This is the address where the customer should pickup the goods and will be shown as the map on the *Customer information page*.

On this page you can select to show a QR-code on the *Customer information page* that is possible to scan with the *Hub app* when the customer come to pickup the goods.

To show a QR-code the following must be valid:

* Display QR-code on the customer page = Yes in this settings page.
* Display the tracking number on the customer page = Yes in [Customer page](settings_customer_page.md).
* The customer order must have a *Tracking number* since this is the value in the QR-code.
