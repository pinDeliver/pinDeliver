# Movie clip - Route optimization

When your orders are created in pinDeliver (Excel upload or api integration) it is time to do the route optimization/planning. When to do the route optimization differs between companies. Some companies do the route planning the day before the deliveries should be made and some just minutes before the vehicles will be loaded. The routing process can be done in just minutes.

Normally the routing is made automatic and you just confirm the resulting routes and assign drivers. But of course it is possible to change the suggested routes manually, both modifying and adding routes.
