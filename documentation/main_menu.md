See information below about the different parts from the main menu.

### Overview
The overview part is also similar to the start page in pinDeliver. This is where you see all plannings orders as an overview page. By default this page filters on planning orders 3 days back but it is possible to change the date filters on your own. this page will also open if you click on the pinDeliver logo in top left corner.

If you want to upload orders from an Excel file you use the green button to the right called **Add order**.

Orders that are uploaded/imported to the *Inbox* are found by clicking on the grey button showing number of orders in the inbox.

### Search customer/delivery
To easily find a customer order you can use the *Search customer/delivery*-functionality from the main menu. It is possible to search for customers based on different criteria.

* Tracking number
* Customer number
* Name
* Address
* Zip code
* City

### Messages
It is possible to send custom messages through SMS or email. This functionality can be triggered from the different routes or manually by clicking on this menu item. It is possible to type an ad-hoc message or use templates.

The message functionality is for example used to trigger manual messages when a route has been delayed for some reason and you want to message all remaining customers.
More information about this functionality can be in [Send custom messages](send_custom_messages.md).

### API
The API section describes the different standard methods used for REST communication to pinDeliver. These are always available and you must first add an API user, read more about this in [Users](users.md).

Another way is to use pinDeliver Service Center as a middleware. Service Center can be used for data-population, business logic etc. This means that it will be easier for you as an integrator if the Service Center is used. Please contact pinDeliver before starting developing an integration.
