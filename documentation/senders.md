# Senders
All customer orders have a sender. A sender can be the transportation company delivering the order or for example the retailer company that sold the goods. A customer order can only have one sender but all customer orders in a planning order can have different senders. The senders are used in the customer communication telling the customer from which sender the goods are coming. This means that each customer order is branded according to the sender, even when many senders share the same route and vehicle.

The sender can be branded by using different logo, colors, instructive text and customer service phone number etc shown on the customers page (GET page).

In pinDeliver you will always have one default sender. This means that if you do not specify a specific sender on a customer order, the default sender will be used.

To create a new sender you select Admin/Senders from the main menu. A list of all senders is shown and you just click **Add new sender** in the bottom of the list. To change an existing sender you just click the sender name or the **Edit** button to open the sender card.
