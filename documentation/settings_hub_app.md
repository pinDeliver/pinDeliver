# The Hub app

The Hub App is primarily designed for use in terminals or warehouses to streamline and improve the handling of goods, enhancing daily operations, and reducing delivery errors. Additionally, it offers a convenient solution for managing packages related to Click & Collect orders. Users can scan the customer information page when customers arrive to collect their packages for Click & Collect orders, making the process smoother and more efficient.
