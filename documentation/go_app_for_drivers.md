# How to use pinDeliver GO App for drivers

The pinDeliver Go app serves as a comprehensive tool designed for drivers, offering a wide array of functionalities. It also provides the flexibility to configure settings that control the driver's view, even though certain information remains mandatory.

We have developed two distinct apps with overlapping functionalities but some notable differences. The web app operates directly within your device's web browser, making it compatible with virtually all devices equipped with a web browser.

Conversely, the native app is specifically designed for Android and iOS devices. Users may notice slight variations in behavior between the two apps. In the web app, all customer information loads at once when accessing the *Driving list*, while the native app loads each stop individually but automatically upon completing the previous stop. Notably, the native app supports package scanning during both loading and unloading processes, as well as in various other workflows, such as handling returns.

To gain insights into the primary workflows within these different Go Apps, watch the videos below.
