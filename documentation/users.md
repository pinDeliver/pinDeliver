# Users
All people that will work with planning and follow-up needs a login to pinDeliver. That means that they have to be registered as users. Drivers will use the Go-app for their work tasks and they start the app through a clickable link instead of logging in with User ID and password.

A user can have different permissions, both in which functions they can use in the platform and which delivery groups they have access to.

A newly created pinDeliver account will always have one user created and then you can add unlimited users on your own.

The login method can be of three different types:
* Username and password
* Microsoft Office 365 login
* API login (it is recommended to not use an api user to login to the interface)

To create a new user you select Admin/Users from the main menu. A list of all created users is shown and you just click **Add new user** in the bottom of the list. The settings for the user are grouped in different tabs, see below. Fill in all relevant fields in the user card and click **Create user** to save it. See image and field explanations below for each tab.

### Basic information
The first settings tab is the basic settings with name and similar values.

### Company
On this tab you select which companies the user should have access to. For most users and companies you will only be able to select your own company.

### Delivery groups
On this tab you select which delivery groups a user should have access to. By default a user will have access to all delivery groups and then nothing needs to be changed. But to limit the access you select the *Access only to the following delivery groups* and then you just drag´n´drop the delivery group from the red "No access"-square to the green "Access"-square to the left. You can also use the arrows between the squares to move all groups at once. (This is useful if a user should have access to more or less all delivery groups. Give access to all and then remove the few that should not be accessed, or vice versa.)

But to limit the access you select the *Access only to the following senders* and then you just drag´n´drop the senders from the red "No access"-square to the green "Access"-square to the left. You can also use the arrows between the squares to move all senders at once. (This is useful if a user should have access to more or less all senders.

## Permissions
Once the user is created you need to assign permissions for the user. Permissions is equal to different functionality in the platform. It is possible to select very or individual functionalities for the user. Below you can see recommended "user permission groups" for different user types. But this is all up to your company. To specify permissions for a user just click on the tab *Permissions* in the user list.

Click the username to open the user permission card for the selected user. Select the permissions you want for the user and then click **Save permissions**. See below for an explanation of the different permissions that are available.

### Permission groups/User roles
You don´t find any predefined permission groups (or user roles) in pinDeliver. This is of course because each company can have different needs. Below you can see a suggestion for user roles. A specific user can of course have two or more roles and then you can just combine permissions for that user.

* Transport planning
* Customer service
* Administrator
* Superuser
