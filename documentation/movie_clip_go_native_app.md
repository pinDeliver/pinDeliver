# Movie clip - Go Driver native app

The pinDeliver Go app is a tool for the driver. This is an app with a lot of functionality and it is also possible to use different settings to control what should be visible for the driver even though some information is mandatory.

The native app is developed for Android and iOS devices and supports package scanning when loading and unloading and in some other flows, for example returns.
