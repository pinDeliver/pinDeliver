# Transport planning

When your orders are created in pinDeliver (Excel upload or api integration) it is time to do the route optimization/planning. When to do the route optimization differs between companies. Some companies do the route planning the day before the deliveries should be made and some just minutes before the vehicles will be loaded. The routing process can be done in just minutes.

Normally the routing is made automatic and you just confirm the resulting routes and assign drivers. But of course it is possible to change the suggested routes manually, both modifying and adding routes.

#### Start route optimization
To start route optimization for a specific planning order you just click the order name. If pinDeliver couldn't find coordinates for any customer order you will see a list of the customer orders that you need to correct yourself. Otherwise you will come directly to the vehicle list.

The vehicle lis shows all available vehicles for the delivery group that the planning order belongs to. You can easily deselect any vehicles you donÂ´t want to use for this route optimization. It is also possible to change predefined values for each vehicle for only this routing. The vehicle will still keep the default values for the next routing.

To start the optimization you just click **Perform automatic routing**. Depending on how complex the planning order is the routing will take more or less time but normally the routing is done in less than a minute.
