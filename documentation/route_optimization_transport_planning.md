# Route optimization and transport planning

Once your orders have been generated in pinDeliver, either through Excel upload or API integration, the next step is to start the route optimization and planning process. The timing of this optimization process varies among companies. Some choose to perform route planning the day prior to the scheduled deliveries, while others opt for last-minute planning just before loading their vehicles. The route optimization process itself can be accomplished in a matter of minutes.

Typically, the routing process is automated, allowing you to simply confirm the proposed routes and assign drivers. However, it is worth noting that manual adjustments to suggested routes, including modifications and the addition of new routes, are entirely feasible.

For a comprehensive demonstration of the route planning functionality, watch the video below.

#### Start route optimization
To start the route optimization for a specific planning order, simply click on the order name. In cases where pinDeliver could not retrieve coordinates for certain customer orders, you will encounter a list of these orders that require manual correction. Otherwise, you will be directed straight to the vehicle list.

The vehicle list displays all available vehicles associated with the delivery group to which the planning order belongs. You have the flexibility to deselect any vehicles you do not wish to include in this route optimization. Additionally, you can modify predefined values for each vehicle exclusively for this routing, while the default values will remain intact for subsequent routings.

To start the optimization process, click on **Perform automatic routing**. Depending on the complexity of the planning order, the routing process may vary in duration, but typically, routing is completed in under a minute.
