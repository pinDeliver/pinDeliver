# Delivery groups
Delivery groups are essential when running pinDeliver. Many entities are connected to one or more delivery groups. You can use delivery groups for dividing deliveries into planning orders. For example based on different warehouse locations and/or user permissions. A delivery can only be connected to one delivery group. And planning orders can only consist of deliveries to the same delivery group, which means that a rout will also only have deliveries to the same delivery group. It is possible to have several planning orders for the same delivery group for the same day.

Each delivery group can also have a depot. A depot can be considered as a loading location that doesn't have to be on the same physical location as where the vehicles are starting. A depot is mandatory when using dynamics pickup and delivery or reloading functionality. If you want to include loading time in the routes it is also mandatory to use depots.

To create a new delivery group you select Admin/Delivery groups from the main menu. A list of all created delivery groups is shown and you just click **Add new delivery group** in the bottom of the list.
