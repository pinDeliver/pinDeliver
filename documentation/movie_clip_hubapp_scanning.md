# Movie clip - The HubApp

The HubApp is designed to optimize your warehouse and terminal management.

It's available for Android devices and the main feature is scanning, supporting both IR scanning and use of your smartphone camera. Additionally, the HubApp allows regular smartphones to connect to Bluetooth IR-scanners for more scanning options.

With the HubApp, you can easily scan goods during linehaul loading, arrival and sorting. You can also use the app to gather information about packages and create or change package structures. This is especially helpful when building pallets or rollcages.

Moreover, the HubApp allows you to perform quality checks and generate package status reports, making it an excellent resource for effective and efficient goods management.
