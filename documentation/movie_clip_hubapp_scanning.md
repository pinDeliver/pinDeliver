The HubApp is designed to streamline your warehouse and terminal management.

It's compatible with Android devices and its primary function is scanning, supporting both IR scanning and smartphone camera use. Moreover, the HubApp allows regular smartphones to connect to Bluetooth IR-scanners for expanded scanning options.

With the HubApp, you can easily scan goods during linehaul loading, arrivals, and sorting. It also provides the convenience of accessing package information and creating or adjusting package structures, which comes in handy for tasks like pallet or rollcage assembly.

Furthermore, the HubApp enables quality checks and the generation of package status reports, making it a valuable tool for efficient goods management.
