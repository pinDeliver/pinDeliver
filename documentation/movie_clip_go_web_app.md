# Movie clip - Go Driver web-app

The pinDeliver Go app is a tool for the driver. This is an app with a lot of functionality and it is also possible to use different settings to control what should be visible for the driver even though some information is mandatory.

The web app runs directly in your web browser on the device which means that more or less all devices with a web browser can run this app.
